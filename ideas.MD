# Guidelines

## Re-works

### Re-work the home. Change the home characters list entirely and add a better layout with fine grain and in-the-air animation/transition beteween character

First steps:

Find the right stylished layout (see dribble, behance, uimovement etc... for good ideas)

Create great animation

### Re-work the menu animation becaus the current one is laggy and impact website performance

We want a more simple animation, with not too much translations/transformations

## New features

### Create a nice splash screen with svg animated based on circle which fill step by step all around the website title that use the Tintin font face

A lot of transitions/animations (because not too much elements to animate on this screen typically), but we want them as simple as possible
